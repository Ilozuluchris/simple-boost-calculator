# Simple Boost Calculator

This is a calculator(hmm estimator) that gets the amount of boost to be expected.

It is based on the [Primsa Finance Project](https://app.prismafinance.com/vaults) and it essentially answers the question <b>"Based on my current protocol deposits, what boost can I expect if I lock in *X* PRISMA for *Y* amount of time"</b>

This is built with python and [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), it is currently live [here](https://simple-boost-calculator-ihhdygvkvbjcqr8rs8j3nq.streamlit.app/)
